        It’s dark<br>
        It’s in the forgotten, and the wished to be forgotten<br>
        A gray shade dominating the story—<br>
        Life isn’t black or white, and I guess<br>
        This is just a part of life<br>
        It was lighter the first time<br>
        Fifteen years old<br>
        On the couch of a party<br>
        Older kids, younger me<br>
        I looked for the manual on how to play it cool,<br>
        But found too many drinks instead<br>
        Told him I was upset, he heard opportunity<br>
        Things went one way, my wishes the other<br>
        But it wasn’t too bad, light and harmless<br>
        Right?<br>
        It wasn’t that far, things could be worse<br>
        Cover up, move along. The rumors will fade,<br>
        Along with the hickey<br>
        He’ll get the high five tomorrow, and my feelings<br>
        —I'm fine.<br>
        But, why do I feel so haunted?<br>
        Why do I feel so dirty?<br>
        He was the first for something, but not for everything.<br>
        This happens everyday, it was just about time…<br>
        Right? Oh...so light.<br>
        The second time, learning what grey is.<br>
        Seventeen now—senior year and<br>
        The world is ours,<br>
        Or maybe just his.<br>
        The closest of friends, the most comfortable of parties<br>
        Come upstairs, we will just go to sleep<br>
        He said<br>
        With all our friends a mere hallway away,<br>
        He heard yes within no<br>
        My reasons weren’t good enough,<br>
        He said<br>
        I can tell you want it,<br>
        He said<br>
        This was supposed to happen,<br>
        He said<br>
        Then why did I leave, up before the light<br>
        Before the pancakes and the coffee<br>
        The hungover stories of the best friends I’d ever had<br>
        Instead kept company by my car’s loud music,<br>
        Drowning too many thoughts and falling tears<br>
        And the familiar feeling of dirty,<br>
        Inexplicably tainted<br>
        Telling myself it’s not so bad, you’ll be okay—<br>
        And with the sun breaking the dawn,<br>
        It was all just...gray<br>
        The next time was worse.<br>
        I knew the feeling, and at some point,<br>
        This has to all be my fault, right?<br>
        A perfect, care free night<br>
        Eighteen years old with the card saying twenty–one<br>
        roaming a new city, bars and clubs and the freedom to dance<br>
        Again, on top of the world<br>
        It’s 3 a.m. and couch surfing is the name of the game<br>
        An old friend, A best friend, A new friend<br>
        With the fogginess of a night’s worth of drinks,<br>
        We fell asleep—three squeezed onto a bed for two<br>
        As the only girl, I laid in the middle—<br>
        Not a question, not a worry<br>
        Only to wake up with him inside,<br>
        Probing, exploring, taking what he wanted<br>
        A perfect night resolved to a memory<br>
        Where in the fog of a moment, I must somehow be in the wrong<br>
        I am the dirty one.<br>
        I am the reason this happens.<br>
        They take what they can because of something I say,<br>
        Or maybe do.<br>
        And with a swift move to the floor, he was forced to stop<br>
        But there was silence in the morning<br>
        And there were memories tainted<br>
        And the girl who was on top of the world,<br>
        Felt thrown to the ground,<br>
        beneath the touch of another<br>
        The last time<br>
        I decided it had to be my fault<br>
        For not standing up when I was fifteen<br>
        For not saying something to the cat calls from then to now<br>
        For the comments left untouched,<br>
        With my own body not getting off so lucky<br>
        For the times I am called a tease, or maybe a whore<br>
        And I let both stand, so as to not raise a fuss.<br>
        The lack of fuss must have led to this last time<br>
        One that is either a bit too recent,<br>
        Or maybe a bit too timeless to tell<br>
        The story of so many—of the night that goes too far<br>
        Of the signs ignored and<br>
        The empty feelings left behind.<br>
        It is not just one night,<br>
        It’s the stories between,<br>
        Often so normalized we forget they happen<br>
        The grabs,<br>
        The calls,<br>
        The whispers,<br>
        The taunts.<br>
        It’s in the fear to drink and the<br>
        Guilt for that fear.<br>
        It’s in the self–blaming,<br>
        And the guilt for daring to blame oneself.<br>
        It’s in the forgotten, in the dark<br>
        And the true fear<br>
        that the girl<br>
        On top of the world<br>
        The wild one, the carefree one<br>
        Will one day forget entirely<br>
        Of how to live,<br>
        scared of the dark<br>
        Life has shown her when she does
