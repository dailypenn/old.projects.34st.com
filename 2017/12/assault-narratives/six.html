        all you left was a thread<br>
        tugged and torn<br>
        is it common to leave<br>
        someone so senseless<br>
        took away my sight<br>
        pinpointed irises<br>
        splashed with color<br>
        pupils dilated so slight<br>
        censored the bits<br>
        that you couldn’t shape<br>
        blurred the lines<br>
        that you didn’t like<br>
        reality once perceptive<br>
        left squinting through<br>
        gaslit night<br>
        took away my ears<br>
        melodies, voices, echoes<br>
        diluted into watered–down<br>
        suggestive murmurs that remain<br>
        your deafening<br>
        throes of misplaced<br>
        rage and blame<br>
        bought my silence<br>
        'i want to hold your hand’<br>
        audio left tainted<br>
        ink-splattered sheets<br>
        once composed for us<br>
        took away my touch<br>
        hunger insatiable, lustful thought<br>
        claimed my body, my skin<br>
        a primal leash pulled taut<br>
        the one source of solace<br>
        astray, naught<br>
        a dog must feel comfort<br>
        tied back by his usual chain<br>
        <br>
        flesh and pleasure<br>
        words that seem<br>
        like they would rhyme<br>
        but were never meant to<br>
        took away my taste<br>
        the sweetness in the air<br>
        the soft pretzels<br>
        they sold by the pier<br>
        the pizza overpriced<br>
        for pizza that is<br>
        the grease<br>
        had to blot with a napkin<br>
        i watched a bitter end<br>
        sprout a sour start<br>
        to what would grow<br>
        towering pillars of salt<br>
        took away my smell<br>
        the scent of betrayal<br>
        hard to detect<br>
        amongst dirty laundry<br>
        the trash goes out<br>
        on tuesday<br>
        and it was saturday<br>
        there’d be too much now<br>
        but you held my<br>
        nostrils shut<br>
        and told me I was<br>
        in a rose garden<br>
        how could i see it your way<br>
        how would i listen better<br>
        how should i speak up<br>
        why should i feel like this<br>
        the thread you left me<br>
        <br>
        is more than enough<br>
        to patch the holes<br>
        in my sense of self
