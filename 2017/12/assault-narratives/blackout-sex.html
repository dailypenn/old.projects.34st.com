      <p>One night during my first month of college out with a few friends, I happened to run into a boy I knew from high school on Spruce Street. Everyone was drunkenly milling about, as per usual on a Friday night around that area of campus. He tagged along with us to frat parties. I blacked out at some point. I don't remember any part of what happened afterwards. I don't remember who initiated it. I don't remember leaving the party with him, away from my friends. I don't remember him taking me back to his high rise apartment. I do remember waking up naked in his bed at 7 a.m. the next morning. </p>
      <p>Stunned, or even shocked, is the wrong word to describe how I felt in those minutes before I shakily and shamefully walked back to the Quad in rumpled, sweaty clothes. I just felt so hollow. That is the exact word that I personified. A year later, I'm still coming to terms with being assaulted and feeling comfortable to talk about the night with a few select friends.</p>
      <p>I've always been told your rapist is most likely to be someone you know. I see the guy sometimes on Locust Walk or randomly in Huntsman. I don't feel afraid of him. I don't believe he is inherently evil or immoral. I don't even think I hate him. Should I feel angrier and want to hurt him back, just like he hurt me? I don't know. I'm sure about the following: blackout sex is rape, nonconsensual, and wrong even though Penn culture trivializes it. Don't engage in it, don't promote it, don't tell your friends it's okay.</p>
