      <p>Why does your face look like that? </p>
      <br>
      <p>He asked me, annoyed.</p>
      <p>Not understanding, or just not caring, that he was ripping me apart. </p>
      <p>I wasn’t sure which.</p>
      <p>Next thing I know, I’m running home. Whipping around corners and leaping across streets. Trying to outrun what just happened. </p>
      <p>When I finally make it home, I am out of it. Still drunk, staggering, I knock a glass off of my nightstand as I fall into bed. It shatters. I cry myself to sleep, choking on my actions. </p>
      <p>It’s such a cliché to blame yourself, but I did. Oh, I really did. </p>
      <p>Friend of a friend, we struck up a conversation for the first time on Facebook a week before and randomly came upon the subject of virginity. I told him that I didn’t need some grand romantic night with candles and rose petals and the love of my life. I just wanted someone who mattered, someone not in the picture yet for me. He knew this. Yet, he still decided to take me behind the dugout of a baseball field and fuck me on the gravel ground. </p>
      <p>The later blood–splattered gravel ground. </p>
      <p>I took what happened and folded it, crumpled it, crammed it deep down inside of me where I hoped it would never, ever come back up. Whenever I remembered what he stole from me, what I could never have back, it was like being stabbed swiftly with a thin sword deep into my chest. Waiting for the train to school. In chemistry class. At the lunch table. In the middle of soccer practice. I never knew when it would claw its way back up. I would be happy, laughing with friends, and then out of nowhere the stabbing, cutting, reminding me that I couldn’t be happy. </p>
      <p>I tried to convince myself that I never cared about the idea of virginity anyway, that it wasn’t real, that it didn’t matter. But it did matter. He had it.</p>
