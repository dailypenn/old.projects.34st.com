      <h1>End the Silence</h1>
      <h3>Sexual Assault Survivors at Penn Share Their Stories</h3>
      <p class="lead">
        <i>Letter from Orly Greenberg, 34th Street Editor-in-Chief</i>
      </p>
      <p class="lead">
        34th Street Magazine's “End the Silence: Sexual Assault Survivors at Penn Share Their Stories,” is an issue entirely comprised of survivors and their testimonies. Some are narratives, some are poems, and all are written by survivors.
      </p>
      <p class="lead">
        For those who felt like there was no way to speak or no one who cared to listen, Street wanted to offer a platform. We’re presenting Penn with the full, honest reality of survivors’ experiences. And there’s no better way to do that than to let them say it themselves.
      </p>
      <p class="lead">
        Make no mistake, these stories will upset you. These are brutal, unflinching, truly horrific testimonies—ones that were difficult to read and compile into a magazine, and perhaps more difficult as an editor to share with the Penn community.
      </p>
      <p class="lead">
        But we would be doing a disservice to all victims—and, in fact, everyone—by not publishing these stories. They’re ugly and hard but they’re true. They’re real. To pretend that assault doesn’t exist, or that it doesn’t exist at Penn, is to be part of the problem.
      </p>
      <p class="lead">
        Our discomfort in reading this material is just a glimpse into the daily life and struggles of a survivor. I urge you to read what you can. I urge you to take on what feels right for you. We’re including warnings on all content, but just to be explicit: this will be graphic, disturbing content that discusses sexual assault and rape in detail.
      </p>
      <p class="lead">
        And still, it’s hard not to find even just a glimmer of hope in these pages. These are survivors who found their voices. These are people brave enough to write down their stories and deliver them to strangers, whether it be for catharsis or to offer insight.
      </p>
      <p class="lead">
        You will find a list of resources at the bottom of each article online, and printed twice in our hard copy on Wednesday. Please note that we will also be present on Wednesday night, 7 – 9 p.m., in The Daily Pennsylvanian office (4015 Walnut Street). We will provide company, food, and hopefully a place to decompress after a difficult day. For those who might need someone to talk to, Penn Benjamins, Penn’s student–run peer counseling group, will be on hand.
      </p>
      <p class="lead">
        For those of you who contributed stories, Street thanks you for your bravery. And for those who wanted to, but weren’t quite ready, or for those who might never be ready, Street too, thanks you for your bravery.
      </p>
