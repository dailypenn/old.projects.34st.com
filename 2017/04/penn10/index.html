It was electric blue, and she was wheeling it beside her. It leaned against a banister while she talked. She had just gotten off the phone with her boss at GQ Magazine.<br><br>“My friends—my two best friends and I—started the scooter trend,” she said. “In our sophomore year. No offense to anybody else, but we really did.”<br><br>Other trends Araba may start: wearing two watches (one on either side of her wrist) and having her own interns (two).<br>But then again, Araba needs two watches, interns and a scooter because she has to be efficient. The College senior balances working part–time at GQ as a Production Assistant, photographing Penn performing arts shows and a handful of other extracurriculars with her Visual Studies courseload.">

She began working in a cancer lab during her sophomore year, and has been there ever since. “It&apos;s so interesting to me,” she said. “It&apos;s a really complicated problem that I think is really worth solving and also could do a lot of good.”">

At first, one might have taken her keeping her coat on as a sign she was in a rush, but the more you talk to Hannah, the more you get a sense that it might very well just be a product of her voracious curiosity—there are simply more interesting things to her than worrying about that. One gets the sense that there&apos;s always something that could pop into her head if you mention the right keyword. It&apos;s not that she isn&apos;t present—she very much is—but she has a mind for constantly learning and sharing. She&apos;ll unexpectedly whip out her phone to show you a speech Mark Zuckerberg was giving in North Carolina that she was listening to while making dinner, or tell you about what a great show Mind of a Chef is or explain the historical relevance of restaurateur Alice Waters.">

Though you might be able to guess at the first two statistics by just looking at him, you might never know the last facts unless you pressed them out of him for hours. It is true that Alek will graduate as one of the most decorated football players to pass through the Ivy League. It is true that he has worked hard enough to earn himself the attention that could potentially get him drafted to the NFL. It is true that he is athletically proficient and puts in hours upon hours of training all year to achieve that proficiency. But, above all else, what is true about Alek Torgersen is that he is deeply humble, and one of the most well–rounded and appreciative members of the Penn community.">
