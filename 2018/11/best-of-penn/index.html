          <p>While the quirky dog-themed decor and unique array of dining rooms are a plus, you come to White Dog for the food. White Dog Cafe is synonymous with some of the best brunch in University City. It’s your go-to spot for an impressive start to Parent’s Weekend, a daytime date with your significant other, or a much-needed boozy breakfast. The first Philadelphia restaurant to prioritize ingredients from local, organic farms, this approachably upscale cafe ensures every dish — from its crispy fried pickles to its decadent stuffed french toast — is fresh. Street’s signature order? The Avocado BLT with an artisan cheese plate to start, obviously.</p>

          <p>Not only Penn’s favorite food truck , Magic Carpet also wins best vegan spot on campus. Offering a plethora of hearty, vegan dishes including tofu meatballs, veggie chili, spicy seitan pepper-steak, Magic Carpet keeps skips the meat without sacrificing flavor. Check out the mix and match salad bar- get the baked tofu and falafel combo salad with a drizzle of tahini dressing- you won’t regret it. Can’t decide? Get a feast platter and sample a variety of specials- personal favorite Dervish Delight (falafel, hummus, tabouli). They’re large enough to share but you won’t want to.  Head over to the Lower Quad Gate or Meyerson Courtyard at 34th, to one of their two food trucks. The lines are never short but we promise it’s worth the wait.</p>

Boasting everything from Middle Eastern classics like tabouli and baba ganouj to creative vegan fare like spicy seitan pepper-steak and tofu meatballs, Magic Carpet has something for everyone. Is it worth the wait? Answer me after you dive into a steaming falafel bowl or bite into a flakey spinach & feta pie. Snag a chocolate chip cookie as you checkout--- vegan, gluten-free and baked fresh every morning, the perfect sweet treat to round out your feast.</p>

          <p>Of all the food trucks lining the stretch of Spruce bordering the Quad, none provide food and service nearly as refined as Chez Yasmine. Run by Jihed Chemhimi -- who Street has profiled in the past -- this campus fixture focuses on using local, fresh produce to make its healthy, often vegetarian and vegan-friendly, dishes. Fan favorites include the vegetable couscous plate, the chicken wistar, and an array of banh mi sandwiches. Using ingredients like herbes de provence and black olive paste, your meal is bound to feel a bit more elevated than the average chicken over rice bowl. In addition to creating interesting dishes, Chemhimi makes a point to get to know his regular customers; next to each menu item are the names of different Penn students who frequently order the item. Every meal comes with free water and a piece of fruit. You can also Venmo – what’s more to ask after waiting in line just long enough that you’ll definitely be walking into your foreign language class in Williams three minutes late?</p>

It’s probably due to the fact that their pizza, made from scratch in front of you, is so good that you don’t need to be drunk at 3 a.m. to enjoy it.

          <p>Penn students tend not to venture uptown past 41st or explore Baltimore. However, sitting on the corner, right across from the Saturday farmer's market, is Clarkville, a restaurant with incredible pizza, an amazing beer selection, and extremely relaxed vibes. If you’re looking for something small, the starters are delicious, ranging from warm cauliflower salad with kale, pickled onions, cauliflower, pieces of bread, and a delicious vinaigrette, to meatballs, roasted mushrooms, and beets. But the pizzas absolutely steal the show. Whether you’re feeling simple and want some plain slices, or you’re willing to venture into the creative world of Honey Pies and White Pies, you will not regret your decision. The pizza is $15, but definitely enough to split with a friend and still leave satisfied. This amazing restaurant is the perfect setting for all your weekend brunch or weekday dinner desires.</p>

          <p>Get this: Chipotle, but pizza. The world of “build your own” has now extended to the American-Italian cuisine and it does not disappoint. Located on Drexel’s campus, Blaze pizza allows you to build your own pizza or choose one of their signature pies. We all know what one person loves on a ‘za can be despised by another (think pineapple), but Blaze’s toppings bar can satisfy any craving. There are 11 sauces to choose from, meats range from your standard sausage and pepperoni to turkey meatballs; veggies include peppers of various color and spice levels, artichokes, broccoli, and more; and cheeses even include a vegan-friendly option. But what really makes Blaze pizza outstanding is the open-flame-oven that bakes your meal in about three minutes. Fast, customizable, and not emptying your wallet (a two topping pizza is $7.75) Blaze is the ideal place for a snack break. Before you leave, don’t forget dessert – I had a chocolate chip cookie with sea salt that made me wonder how something so simple could be so good.</p>

          <p>From your first glance at &pizza’s clean black-and-white color scheme and neon lighting, you can tell that &pizza is not your typical college pizza hub. &pizza’s location on 39th and Walnut opened just earlier this year and instantly became the newest late-night hot spot. It’s probably due to the fact that their pizza, made from scratch in front of you, is so good that you don’t need to be drunk at 3 a.m. to enjoy it. If you’re feeling lazy, choose from popular creations like American Honey and Pineapplejack or build your own pizza by deciding from a variety of fresh options for the sauce, cheese, and toppings.

          <p>From your first glance at &pizza’s clean black-and-white color scheme and neon lighting, you can tell that &pizza is not your typical college pizza hub. &pizza’s location on 39th and Walnut opened just earlier this year and instantly became the newest late-night hot spot. It’s probably due to the fact that their pizza, made from scratch in front of you, is so good that you don’t need to be drunk at 3 a.m. to enjoy it. If you’re feeling lazy, choose from popular creations like American Honey and Pineapplejack or build your own pizza by deciding from a variety of fresh options for the sauce, cheese, and toppings. Most of &pizza’s menu is $11 and under, which is a fairly reasonable price for the amount of food you’re getting.</p>

          <p>Get this: Chipotle, but pizza. The world of “build your own” has now extended to the American-Italian cuisine and it does not disappoint. Located on Drexel’s campus, Blaze pizza allows you to build your own pizza or choose one of their signature pies. We all know what one person loves on a ‘za can be despised by another (think pineapple), but Blaze’s toppings bar can satisfy any craving. There are 11 sauces to choose from, meats range from your standard sausage and pepperoni to turkey meatballs; veggies include peppers of various color and spice levels, artichokes, broccoli, and more; and cheeses even include a vegan-friendly option. But what really makes Blaze pizza outstanding is the open-flame-oven that bakes your meal in about three minutes. Fast, customizable, and not emptying your wallet (a two topping pizza is $7.75) Blaze is the ideal place for a snack break. Before you leave, don’t forget dessert – I had a chocolate chip cookie with sea salt that made me wonder how something so simple could be so good.</p>

          <p>While the quirky dog-themed decor and unique array of dining rooms are a plus, you come to White Dog for the food. White Dog Cafe is synonymous with some of the best brunch in University City. It’s your go-to spot for an impressive start to Parent’s Weekend, a daytime date with your significant other, or a much-needed boozy breakfast. The first Philadelphia restaurant to prioritize ingredients from local, organic farms, this approachably upscale cafe ensures every dish — from its crispy fried pickles to its decadent stuffed french toast — is fresh. Street’s signature order? The Avocado BLT with an artisan cheese plate to start, obviously.</p>

          <p>Looking for a place to walk or run in peace without bumping into your neighbor or TA while drenched in sweat? Head out to Fairmount Park, ten minute drive from campus easily accessible by long walk or SEPTA. The park stretches from the Benjamin Franklin Parkway to North Philly and beyond, splitting into East and West with the Schuylkill river dividing it. In addition to the extremely popular walking/running/biking trail on Kelly Drive, there are two thousand acres of land available to explore by walking or running. While there are many notable landmarks throughout the park, one particularly picturesque and unique one being the Shofuso Japanese House and Garden, which was built in Japan in 1953 and moved to Fairmount Park in 1958. With a koi pond, tea house, waterfall, island, and more, it’s a beautiful sight for tired college eyes.</p>

          <p>As you walk into Pottruck, barely escaping the crisp Fall air, the first thing you see is the 1st floor gym. You see the strong, sweaty plebs circling and territorially intimidating the mere three mats on the floor; they’re waiting to pounce at any second when the person currently on them scrams. You look up to see the rows of treadmills with hamster-like humans running nowhere and staring at blank brick walls. Your eyes barely adjust to oppressive, artificial, yellowish-lights from above. This is no place to work out. Suddenly, you’re scrambling towards the natural light, up the two flights of stairs, warming up your body for your workout without realizing, and now you arrive: the 3rd floor. Here, in the Pilates room, the smooth, glimmering wood floors expand out indefinitely. There are mats hanging everywhere, just for your taking. There are mirrors on ¾ of the walls, so you can admire your beautiful body, and the last wall of paneled glass lets in a flood of natural light. In the gym next door, there are ample treadmills, ellipticals, bikes, and weights for your choosing. On the third floor, you can tower over campus and get a bird’s eye view of what others are doing with their morning as you work out, but with an added sense of superiority from your impressive height. You feel like a CEO with a top–floor, corner office. Or a millionaire in a penthouse suit with a home gym. On the third floor, the people you share the gym with are transformed from red, sweaty beasts to inspiring and graceful dancers, athletes, and go–getters. You are transformed into an inspiring and graceful dancer, athlete, and go–getter.</p>

          <p>If the third floor reaches for the stars in Pottruck, the basement sauna grounds you and calmingly brings you back down to Earth. As you descend underground into the basement of the gym, you feel as if you are walking through a military bunker. Seamlessly, you emerge near the massive swimming pool, the air fills with chlorine, and you hear the water lapping up against the edges of the concrete, lulling you into a trance. Tucked away and often unheard of, Pottruck keeps a simple, yet elegant warm wood box near the end of the pool. With a few stones, a turn of a water, and a deep inhale, this box can transform your stressed–out mind into an inner Zen Garden. Just got your Communications midterm back? Didn’t do so hot? Give yourself a break, throw a towel over that beautiful body of yours and hop into the sauna. This relaxing get–away can immediately transport you from the chilly, oppressive Penn campus to a luxurious ski lodge on a mountain in Switzerland.</p>

In addition to apparel, the bookstore has Penn branded accessories, school supplies, dorm essentials and more! While many of us equate the Bookstore with Penn branded merch, believe it or not the Bookstore actually has an incredible selection of books!
